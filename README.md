# Birthday-Lookup-System🎂🗃️

This project is a C++ program that manages and queries birthday records using a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient storage and retrieval. It provides a menu-driven interface that allows users to load birthday data from a file, list entries sorted by date, search for birthdays by month and day, add new entries with duplicate detection, and save the updated data back to a file. The program is modularly designed with clean separation of concerns across multiple source and header files, using modern C++ features for file handling, memory management, and user interaction.
